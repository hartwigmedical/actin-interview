## Technical Interview Preparation

### Introduction

Welcome! We are excited to have you interview with us.
As part of our interview process, we will work through a small but typical technical task using a subset of our repository.
The main goal of this exercise is to give us a sense of what it would be like to work together.

Before the interview, you will need to check out our repository from GitHub and load it into IntelliJ.

### Preparation Steps

1. **Install IntelliJ IDEA**: If you don't already have IntelliJ IDEA installed, please download and install it from [JetBrains' website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Clone the repository using the GitHub link:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/hartwigmedical/actin-interview.git
      ```
3. **Open the Project in IntelliJ IDEA**:
    - Launch IntelliJ IDEA.
    - Click on `Open` and select the directory where you cloned the repository.
    - IntelliJ IDEA will automatically detect and configure the project.

4. **Project Structure**:
    - Familiarize yourself with the structure of the project.
    - Explore the `src` directory in the `algo` module where you will find the Kotlin source files.

5. **Build the Project**:
    - Make sure the project builds successfully.
    - You can build the project by clicking on `Build` > `Build Project` from the menu bar.

6. **Basic Kotlin Familiarity**:
    - The code is written entirely in Kotlin. If you are new to Kotlin, you might find it useful to review some basic concepts.
    - The official [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html) is a great resource. Consider:
      - [Taking the Kotlin tour](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-tour-welcome.html)
      - [An overview of basic syntax](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-syntax.html)

### What to Expect During the Interview
